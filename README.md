# Tasks
In this task, you need to modify the Django application.
- Implement a password reset mechanism for a registered user;
- All environment variables should be stored in the .env file and used in the settings.py file.

  ## The previous tasks have been completed earlier.
  
  You need to implement an analog of the following website http://quotes.toscrape.com in Django.
  
  1. Implement the ability to register on the site and log in to the site.
  2. The ability to add a new author to the site only for a registered user.
  3. The ability to add a new quote to the site with the author's indication only for a registered user.
  4. Migrate the database from MongoDB, which you have, to Postgres for your site. You can implement it with a custom script. (If you wish, you can leave and work with citations and authors in MongoDB, and with users in Postgres)
  5. You can visit the page of each author without user authentication
  6. All citations are available for viewing without user authentication
  7. Search for quotes by tags. When you click on a tag, a list of quotes with that tag is displayed.
  8. Implement the "Top Ten tags" block and display the most popular tags.
  9. Implement pagination. These are the next and previous buttons.
